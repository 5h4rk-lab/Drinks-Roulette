# 🍹 Drinks Roulette

> A chaotic, college-kid-friendly, mobile-ready web app that picks a drink for you — because decision-making is overrated.

## 🔥 Inspired By

This app is loosely inspired by My previous creation, **Eats Roulette**, but this time… it’s all about the drinks. Whether you're sipping espresso or mixing margaritas, I got you.

## 🎯 What It Does

* Spins a virtual cocktail shaker to pick a random drink.
* Pulls real drink data from [TheCocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).
* Shows image, ingredients, type (alcoholic or not), and how to make it.
* Mobile-optimized and installable as a PWA.

## 🔞 Age Gate

Before you get your virtual cocktail:

> **Are you 21+?**
>
> ⚡ "If you can legally drink, hit YES. If not, here's a Capri Sun and a warm hug." 💁

This gate isn't enforced (yet), but it sets the vibe and the mood.

## 🤘 Made By

Built by the same caffeine-fueled student  who made **Eats Roulette** (tough he had important stuff to deal with). This one’s for the late-night mixers, brunch mimosa squads, and caffeine gremlins.

Cheers 🥂
